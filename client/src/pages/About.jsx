            Welcome to Mar con Art. This blog was created by Mar Prieto as a personal project to share her paintings, artwork, ideas, and tips with the world. The idea was to unite two of my passions, coding and creating magic with art, a developer who is starting in the world of programming and with a future vision of transforming a painting into code.

            In this blog, you will find articles and tutorials on topics such as pigments, brushes, types of paints, and materials used in the creation of a painting. Mar is always creating, learning, and exploring new ways of making pictorial art, so be sure to check back often for new content!
